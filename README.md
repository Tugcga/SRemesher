# S-Remesher addon for Softimage

Implement two remeshing algorithms: [Instant Meshes](https://github.com/wjakob/instant-meshes) and [QuadriFlow](https://github.com/hjwdzh/QuadriFlow). For compiling addon from sources, you need compile both Instant Meshes and QuadriFlow applications as *.lib and then add it to the linker on the addon project.

Compiled version of the addon available [here](https://ssoftadd.github.io/sRemesherPage.html).
